# python-for-data-science
Python is a high-level programming language which has gained a remarkable growth in the field of data science. This repository aims to introduce you to some of the powerful, open-source python libraries used in Data Science including Numeric-Python (Numpy), Pandas, Matplotlib and Scikit-learn.



Welcome to the Python for Data Science repository! This repository contains various projects, scripts, datasets, and resources to help you learn and apply data science techniques using Python.

## Introduction

Data science is a field that combines domain expertise, programming skills, and knowledge of mathematics and statistics to extract meaningful insights from data. Python is one of the most popular languages for data science due to its simplicity and the vast array of libraries available.

This repository aims to provide practical examples and tutorials to help you get started with data science using Python.

## Course Objectives

In this course, you have learnt the following:

- The need for Python libraries
- Using NumPy to work with arrays
- Using Pandas to load, explore, manipulate, analyze and process data
- Derive statistical outcomes from a real dataset
- Visualize data using Matplotlib
- Create a machine learning model for predictive analysis using Scikit-learn

## Installation

To run the scripts and projects in this repository, you'll need to have Python installed on your system. If you're using Anaconda as your Python distribution, you likely already have Python installed along with Jupyter Notebook.

If you don't have Anaconda installed, you can download and install it from the official website: [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution).

After installing Anaconda, you can launch Jupyter Notebook by following these steps:

1. **Open Anaconda Navigator**: Search for Anaconda Navigator in your system's application launcher and open it.

2. **Launch Jupyter Notebook**: In Anaconda Navigator, click on the "Launch" button below the Jupyter Notebook icon. This will open a new browser window with the Jupyter Notebook interface.

3. **Navigate to the Notebook**: Use the file browser in the Jupyter Notebook interface to navigate to the directory containing the notebook files in this repository.

4. **Open and Run Notebooks**: Click on a notebook file (with the `.ipynb` extension) to open it in the Jupyter Notebook editor. You can run the code cells in the notebook interactively by selecting a cell and clicking the "Run" button in the toolbar or by pressing `Shift + Enter`.

You can also create a new Jupyter Notebook by clicking on the "New" button in the Jupyter Notebook interface and selecting "Python 3" or any other available kernel.

If you prefer using the command line, you can launch Jupyter Notebook by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

```bash
jupyter notebook
